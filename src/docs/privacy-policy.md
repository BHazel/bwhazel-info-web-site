# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to all my personal self-hosted web sites or as stated otherwise.  Sites with specific privacy requirements or data collection have their own sections outlinng these at the end of the policy.

## Telemetry

All my web sites use telemetry to collect information on how they are used and general site health.  The following events will collect telemetry:

* Page Load
* Open/Close Popup Section
* Button Click to Access External Site
* Error Page Load

This is powered by the [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) service (part of [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/monitor/)) on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/).  All Application Insights resources are hosted within the UK South region in Microsoft Azure.  The data collected are only visible to me as part of my personal Microsoft Azure account and subscription.

As part of the telemetry, the following personal information is collected and is retained for 90 days:

Data | Example
--- | ---
Date & Time | 27/03/2021, 10:30:00 (Local Time)
Device Type & Model | Browser, Other
Operating System | macOS 10.15
Browser Version | Safari 14.0
IP Address | 127.0.0.1
City, State/Province, Country/Region | Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom

Each telemetry event is assigned a session and user ID by Application Insights, however, these are comprised of random numbers, letters and special characters and cannot be used to identify a user personally.

I only use these data for the purpose of monitoring how the site is used and do not share it with any other individual or organisation.

Please note that I do not collect telemetry from 3<sup>rd</sup> party widgets used on my sites, self-hosted or otherwise, however they may collect their own data.  Please refer to the privacy policies of these providers for more information:

* Google Maps
* MarineTraffic
* SoundCloud
* Windy.com
